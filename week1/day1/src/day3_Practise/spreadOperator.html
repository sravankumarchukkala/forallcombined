<!--What is Spread Operator ?
    
       The spread operator (...) in JavaScript is a very useful feature that 
       allows you to expand the elements of an array or object.

        In the context of arrays, the spread operator can be used to:

          1)Copy an array (shallow copy).
          2)Combine multiple arrays into one.
          3)Extract or collect elements of an array.-->
